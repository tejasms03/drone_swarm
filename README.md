This repo contains details on Collaborative drone tracking using swarms of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). They present significant advantages
in surveillance and monitoring tasks, but pose challenges in
energy efficiency and coordination. This paper introduces an
Enhanced Voronoi Method for Optimizing Energy Consumption
and extending mission duration in multi-UAV target tracking
operations. By partitioning the operational area into Voronoi
cells and implementing a predictive edge-crossing algorithm,
The method strategically assigns drones to active, passive, or
grounded states based on the target’s location and movement
predictions. Real-time object detection is achieved using
The YOLO model ensures accurate and efficient tracking.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms baseline and traditional Voronoi
methods, achieving a high increase in tracking time
and a substantial reduction in average battery consumption
per drone. The Enhanced Voronoi Method effectively enhances
energy efficiency and scalability in collaborative drone tracking,
offering a robust solution for applications requiring prolonged
and reliable UAV operations.
